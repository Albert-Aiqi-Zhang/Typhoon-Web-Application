# Typhoon-Web-Application

Welcome to the World of Typhoon! I built a website and database to display typhoon information from 2000 through 2018 with flask framework and MySQL.

Unfortunately GitHub only supports static webpage, so I can't display images typhoon tracks in the website. If you are interested in it, you can download the source codes, running a server in you PC, and then you can see the typhoon track pictures.
