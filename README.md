# Typhoon-Web-Application

Welcome to the World of Typhoon! I built a website and database to display typhoon information from 2000 through 2018 with flask framework and MySQL.

You can click this link to see the sample of my website: [(simpified) typhoon website](https://albert-aiqi-zhang.github.io/typhoon.github.io/index.html)

![typhoon](https://github.com/Albert-Aiqi-Zhang/Typhoon-Web-Application/blob/main/images/homepage.png)

Unfortunately GitHub only supports static webpage, so I can't display images typhoon tracks in the website. If you are interested in it, you can download the source codes, running a database server in you PC, and then you can see the typhoon track pictures.

There are 5 bottons on the top of homepage. The second one is Introduction. Push it and you will see a brief introduction of typhoon:

![introduction](https://github.com/Albert-Aiqi-Zhang/Typhoon-Web-Application/blob/main/images/introduction.png)

The third one is Search entry. You can select the year from 2001 to 2018. Then you should be able to choose the typhoons in that year. But as I have said, it doesn't support databases here in GitHub, so you cannot enter any more.

![search](https://github.com/Albert-Aiqi-Zhang/Typhoon-Web-Application/blob/main/images/search.png)

Otherwise, you can see the names of typhoon in that year, as follows:

![search-result](https://github.com/Albert-Aiqi-Zhang/Typhoon-Web-Application/blob/main/images/searchResult.png)

Then you can choose any typhoon, and it will diplay typhoon track and some corresponding information:

Although it's a pity that you cannot see it here, you can still download the whole repository and open a server to run it perfectly. Hopefully you enjoyed my typhoon website!
